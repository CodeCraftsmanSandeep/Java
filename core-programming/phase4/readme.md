# Java Learning Journey: Phase 4 ðŸ“ˆ

In this phase I have learnt how to write modular, systematic, and scalable code in java using object oriented programming (OOPS). OOPS is one of the popularly followed programming paradigm because of following benfits of using OOPS:
1) Modularity (classes and objects)
2) Encapsulation (data attributes and methods)
3) Resuability (through composition and inheritence)
4) Abstraction (provides API's, hides complexity)
5) Ease of maintenance (easy to understand, manage, update code )
6) Scalability (due to modularity)
7) Enhances collaboration
8) Polymorphism
