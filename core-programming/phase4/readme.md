# Java Learning Journey: Phase 4 ðŸ“ˆ

In this phase I have learnt how to write modular, systematic, and scalable code in java using object oriented programming (OOPS). OOPS is one of the popularly followed programming paradigm because of following benfits of using OOPS:
1) Modularity (classes and objects)
2) Encapsulation (data attributes and methods)
3) Resuability (through composition and inheritence)
4) Abstraction (provides API's, hides complexity)
5) Ease of maintenance (easy to understand, manage, update code )
6) Scalability (due to modularity)
7) Enhances collaboration
8) Polymorphism

## Learnings from [example1](example1/)
In [example1](example1/) I have created a class User, and the code helps in understanding how we can create objects, how we can call methods of a class, how we can access data attributes in class etc..  

## Learnings from [example2](example2/)
In [example2](example2/) I created two classes User, Book. A User can borrow a book with the help of ```borrow()``` method of the class User.  
We can make data attributes private and create methods to get data of the object.  

## Learnings from [example3](example3/)
In [example3](example3/) I learned how to implement inheritence in Java.  
In [example3](example3/), AudioBook and Ebook are two classes that inherit data attributes and methods from Book class.
