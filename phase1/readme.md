## Datatypes
- Primitive data types (eg: int, float .. )
- Non-primitive data types

## Variable declarations
Alphabet set for variables = {$, _, 0, .., 9, A, B, .., Z, a, b, ...., z}
Note that java allows $  

## Type conversion
- implicit conversion
- explicit conversion
See [code2](code2.java) which is a good example to understand the above different kinds of type conversion.  

## Operators
- Arthimetic operators (+, -, /, *, %)
- Relational operators (==, !=, >, >=, <, <=)
- Assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, =)
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Biwise operators (&, |, ^, ~)
- Binary shift operators ( <<, >> )
- Ternary operator ( ? :)

### Operator associativity and precedence
To avoid ambiguity (while lexical phase of a compiler) there is a presedence (or) associativity attatched to each operator.  <br/>
Ofcourse, there is always a way to skip learning operator precedence and associativity by placing parenthesis at needed locations.  <br/>
But knowing about operator precedence and associativity helps in faster debugging. (Many times overlooking operator precedence (or) associativity leads to errors which take lot of time to debug)  


## Important points
* Java does not allow to use unitialized variable  (see [code1](code1.java))
* Java is not strictly typed. (for example: int/double is allowed in Java)
