## Datatypes
- Primitive data types (eg: int, float .. )
- Non-primitive data types (eg: string, arrays ..)

## Variable declarations
Alphabet set for variables = {$, _, 0, .., 9, A, B, .., Z, a, b, ...., z}
Note that java allows $  

## Type conversion
- implicit conversion
- explicit conversion
See [code2](code2.java) which is a good example to understand the above different kinds of type conversion.  

## Operators
- Arthimetic operators (+, -, /, *, %)
- Relational operators (==, !=, >, >=, <, <=)
- Assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=, %=, =)
- Logical operators (&&, ||, !)
- Biwise operators (&, |, ^, ~)
- Binary shift operators ( <<, >> )
- Ternary operator ( ? :)
- Post increment, Post decrement, Pre increment, Pre decrement (++, --)

### Operator associativity and precedence
- To avoid ambiguity (during lexical phase of a compiler) there is a precedence (or) associativity attatched to each operator.  <br/>
- Ofcourse, there is always a way to skip learning operator precedence and associativity by placing parenthesis at needed locations.  <br/>
- But knowing about operator precedence and associativity helps in faster debugging. (Many times overlooking operator precedence (or) associativity leads to errors which take lot of time to debug)  <br/>

## Learning strings
- See [code4](code4.java) to know the ways to declare a string.
- See [code5](code5.java) to know what's the major difference between the above ways of declaring.
- See [code6](code6.java) to know the following methods of string:  
  - format()
  - length()
  - isEmpty()
  - toUpperCase()
  - toLowerCase()
  - equals()
  - equalsIgnoreCase()
  - replace()
  - contains()


## Important points
* Java does not allow to use unitialized variable  (see [code1](code1.java))
* Java is not strictly typed. (for example: int/double is allowed in Java)
