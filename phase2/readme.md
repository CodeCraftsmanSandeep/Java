# Phase 2 learning

## Learnings in [code1](code1.java)
* Taking input from the user.
  * importing java.util.Scanner module
  * creating Scanner object
  * nextLine() method 
  * Using print() method instead of println()
  * Do not forget to close the Scanner object :)
  * Using printf() (same as in c++)
  * nextInt() to get integer input
  * nextDouble(), nextFloat()
  * After using nextInt, you can call nextLine once to consume the remaining newline character from the buffer. This ensures the next nextLine call reads the user's complete line input.
  * Output: <br/> ![output1](output1.png)

## Learnings in [code2](code2.java)

* [code2](code2.java) contains code of a simple calculator
* Be careful of the phenomenon of **fall-through** when there is no ```break``` in case block

## Leanrings in [code3](code3.java)
