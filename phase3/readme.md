## Dynamic arrays
* Dyanmic arrays are arrays that can change their size compared to statuc arrays. (Internally dynamic arrays are implemeneted using static arrays but by smartly allocating the space everytime there is a need to resize the memeory allocated. Generally if n is the size, we allocate 2*n more size) see [MIT lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHhwJjR0mZA&list=PLUl4u3cNGP63EdVPNLG3ToM6LaEUuStEY&index=2) to know about this.
* Integer vs int <br/>
  | Featrue | int | Integer |
  |---------|-----|---------|
  |Type	    |Primitive Data Type	| Wrapper Class|
  |Memory Efficiency	| More efficient (stores raw integer value)	| Less efficient (some overhead for object  structure) |
  |Functionalities	| Limited (no methods)	| Provides methods for conversion, comparison, etc.|
  | Usage	| Simple integer storage	| Object-oriented features, conversions, etc. |
